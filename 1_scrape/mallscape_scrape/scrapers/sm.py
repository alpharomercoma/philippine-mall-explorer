Uses the same JSON endpoints the site's own JS calls (verified 2026-07):

- ``GET /list-of-malls?region=<r>&keyword=&page=<n>``  -> paginated mall list
- ``GET /tenants?category=all&subCategory=all&mallCode=<CODE>&keyword=all&``

Gotchas: filter params must literally be the string ``all`` (empty strings
