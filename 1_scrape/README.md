# Stage 1: scrape

**Reads** twelve operator websites. **Writes** `data/snapshots/<date>/1_scrape/`.

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `malls.parquet` / `.csv` | one row per property |
| `stores.parquet` / `.csv` | one row per store listing, exactly as published |
| `run_report.md` | counts, diff against the previous snapshot, warnings |

`malls` carries `lat`, `lon`, `geo_source` and `geo_precision`. See
"Coordinates" below for who owns them.

Run it with `uv run mallscape scrape`, or one chain with `--chain sm`.

## What this stage promises

Store names are recorded **verbatim**. No case folding, no trimming beyond
whitespace, no guessing. Everything interpretive belongs to stage 2, so the
raw record stays auditable against the source page forever.

## How it is organized

`registry_of_scrapers.py` maps a chain id to its class, and is the only list of
chains in the repository. `pipeline.py` orchestrates a run and owns the
carry-forward rule. `fetch.py` is the single HTTP client: rate limited, retrying
with backoff, and caching every response to `data/cache/<date>/<chain>/` so
re-parsing costs nothing.

Each scraper in `scrapers/` subclasses `MallChainScraper` and implements
`discover_malls()` and `scrape_mall()`. Its module docstring records the
endpoints, the quirks, and any dead domain that should not be re-added. Read
that docstring before changing a parser.

## Coordinates

Ayala and Megaworld publish coordinates in their own APIs, and their scrapers
record them as `geo_source=operator`. Nothing else may overwrite those.

Every other property is placed from `registry/mall_coordinates.json`, which is
committed. `pipeline.place()` reads it on every run and never touches the
network, so the map is reproducible and a scrape works offline.

`uv run mallscape geocode` is the only thing that changes that file. It resolves
whatever the registry cannot answer, using one Overpass query for every named
retail feature in the country, then Nominatim at one request per second for the
remainder. `geocode.py` explains the matching rules; the short version is that a
candidate needs either an exact name or agreement between its name and the
region we already hold, because our region test is coarse enough to disagree
with a correct pin near a boundary.

The registry owns its column outright: if an entry is deleted, the coordinate
disappears from the next run rather than lingering in the parquet. That is what
makes `place()` idempotent.

## The rule that keeps this stage honest

**Silence must never mean success.** A scraper that cannot derive its mall list
live verifies its hardcoded roster against the site on every run and warns on
drift. A property the operator does not list at all is recorded in
`registry/<chain>_coverage.json` so it stays explained instead of being
re-investigated. Truncation is routed around where a route exists: WalterMart's
per-mall pages cap at 10 tenants per category, so that scraper reads the
chain-wide store index and each store's branch API instead.

**A zero is re-asked before it is believed.** A mall that yields no tenants is
scraped a second time with the HTTP cache bypassed, because a cached body
cannot tell an empty directory apart from a failed request - SM City La Union
published nothing in July and 199 tenants in August. Only an empty answer from
the live network is recorded, and it then has to be accounted for in
`registry/empty_directories.json`, with evidence and a date. Anything empty and
absent from that file is reported as an unexplained defect. Malls holding under
a quarter of their chain's median are named in the same report, which is how
five grocery stores classified as malls were found.

`registry/unscraped_chains.json` records operators that were investigated and
deliberately not scraped, with the evidence and what would have to change.

## Cost

A cold full run is roughly 3,000 requests and about 25 minutes at the default
3 requests per second. With the cache present it is seconds and touches no
network. Do not raise the rate: SM's WAF issues a temporary site-wide 403 at
sustained higher rates. See `docs/PITFALLS.md`.
